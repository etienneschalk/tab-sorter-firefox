# Tab Sorter Auto-Sort Fix - Implementation Test

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Event Listeners
- **Modified `chrome.tabs.onCreated`**: Now uses delayed execution (50ms) and retry mechanism
- **Added `chrome.tabs.onUpdated`**: Backup mechanism to catch missed tabs
- **Added `pendingSortTabs` tracking**: Set to track tabs awaiting sorting

### 2. New `sortTabsWithRetry` Function
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 retries with 100ms delays
- **Tab Validation**: Checks if new tab exists in query results before sorting
- **Fallback**: Proceeds with sort even if tab not found after max retries

### 3. Improved Logging
- Added detailed debug logging for troubleshooting
- Tracks retry attempts and tab validation

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Load the Extension**
   - Load the updated extension in Chrome/Firefox
   - Enable "Auto-sort on new tab" in the extension popup

2. **Test Single Tab Creation**
   - Open a new tab (Ctrl+T)
   - Verify the tab gets sorted immediately
   - Check browser console for debug messages

3. **Test Multiple Tab Creation**
   - Open several tabs quickly
   - Verify all tabs get sorted properly
   - Check that no tabs are left unsorted

4. **Test Different Tab Types**
   - Test with regular tabs
   - Test with pinned tabs (should remain pinned)
   - Test with tabs from different domains

### Expected Behavior

- **First tab**: Should be sorted immediately (fixes the original issue)
- **Subsequent tabs**: Should continue to be sorted properly
- **Console logs**: Should show retry attempts and successful sorting
- **Performance**: Minimal impact with reasonable delays

### Debug Information

The extension now logs detailed information:
- `New tab created: [tabId], scheduling sort with delay`
- `Attempt X/4 for tab [tabId]`
- `Tab [tabId] found/not found after max retries, proceeding with sort`
- `Tab updated and completed: [tabId], triggering sort`

## Files Modified

- `template-extension/tab-sorter.js` - Main implementation
- `build/chrome-extension/tab-sorter.js` - Chrome build
- `build/firefox-extension/tab-sorter.js` - Firefox build

## Technical Details

### Race Condition Fix
The original issue was caused by a race condition where `chrome.tabs.onCreated` fired before the new tab was fully integrated into the browser's tab system. The fix addresses this by:

1. **Delayed Execution**: 50ms delay ensures tab is integrated
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Up to 3 retries with validation
3. **Backup Listener**: `onUpdated` catches any missed tabs
4. **Tab Tracking**: Prevents duplicate sorting operations

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimal Delay**: 50ms initial delay is barely perceptible
- **Retry Limits**: Maximum 3 retries prevents infinite loops
- **Memory Management**: `pendingSortTabs` set is cleaned up after sorting
- **Efficient Validation**: Simple `Array.some()` check for tab existence

This implementation should resolve the issue reported in GitHub Issue #14 where auto-sort only happened on the second new tab.
